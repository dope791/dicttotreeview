Package release
================

Packages will only be published when **``version``** is a valid string (without characters).  
Thus **no alpha-versions** will be released.  
You should specify the **``version``** in ``setup.py`` and ``dicttotreeview/__init__.py``.

To access the icons used by the window, pull `lib/` too.
