In ``examples`` you can find a version of ``main.py``,``usercode.py`` and the ``MainWindow.py``.
    - ``MainWindow.py`` describes the layout of the window that is used for this example-GUI. This was created with QtDesigner and generated with ``pyuic5``.  
    - ``main.py`` uses the implemented ``usercode.py`` and the package ``dicttotreeview``. 
    - ``usercode.py`` is an example. Recommended is a *sensor-class* and a *window*.


# Run the example

1. Install `DictToTreeView`
2. Clone this project to your local host. 
3. Open the folder *example* (e.g. with Visual Studio Code) 
4. Run the `main.py` file. 


There is an example on how to use the package in `main.py`.  
The view will be updated automatically in the selected area.   
An exemplary timer is used for clock here.
